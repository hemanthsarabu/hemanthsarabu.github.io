<p>Research on collaborative arms that use surveying and servoing as canonical tasks to discover and harvest apples. Designed and implemented algorithms for full intelligence pipeline, from apple detection (custom YOLO), mapping and planning for robustness and scalability. Simulations in V-REP and experiments in real orchards using two UR5s and Realsense cameras. Leveraging and extending the idea of clear path detection (subspace planning) in contrast to expensive state of the art methods.</p>
<p>Exploring novel sampling techniques in conjunction with autoencoders to form smart priors on trajectories. </p>
