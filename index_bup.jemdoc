I am a MSCSE candidate at Georgia Tech interested in Reinforcement Learning, Mod conducting research robotics research at the [https://www.gtri.gatech.edu/laboratories/aerospace-transportation-advanced-systems-laboratory Georgia Tech Research Institute] and the [https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~bboots3/ Robot Learning Lab, Georgia Institute of Technology].

My research interests include Reinforcement Learning for Uncertain Spaces, Efficient Sampling and Dimensionality Reduction for Control

I worked with [https://www.iitk.ac.in/aero/mangal/ Dr. Mangal Kothari] during my masters at IIT Kanpur. 

Here is my [files/Hemanth_Sarabu.pdf resume].

Research Assistant \n
February 2018 - Present \n 
Atlanta \n

-- Perception and Planning in Highly Unstructured Environments \n
-- Collaborative Apple Picking Robots \n
-- Reduced Order Planning and Sampling \n

Research on collaborative arms that use surveying and servoing as canonical tasks to discover and harvest apples. Designed and implemented algorithms for full intelligence pipeline, from apple detection (custom YOLO), mapping and planning for robustness and scalability. Simulations in V-REP and experiments in real orchards using two UR5s and Realsense cameras. Leveraging and extending the idea of clear path detection (subspace planning) in contrast to expensive state of the art methods.

Exploring novel sampling techniques in conjunction with autoencoders to form smart priors on trajectories.
